# FaceMaskDetectorUsingYolov8
Real-time face mask detection system using deep learning and computer vision. Built with Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras, this project detects human faces in live video streams and classifies them as “mask” or “no mask” using a custom-trained CNN model. Suitable for public safety, healthcare, and surveillance applications.
